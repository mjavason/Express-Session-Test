# Express Session Test API

A simple Express and TypeScript API developed to evaluate and test express-session functionality. This API is tailored for session management using express-session. Upon user login, a session is established on the server, granting access to secure endpoints.

## Main Scripts

1. **Build**

   - Command: `npm run build`
   - Use this script to build the project, the initial step in setting up the API.

2. **Start**

   - Command: `npm run start`
   - Once the project is built, use this command to start the API for production use.

3. **Development Mode**

   - Command: `npm run dev`
   - This script is ideal for development as it enables live-reloading and other helpful tools for debugging and testing.

4. **Unit Testing**
   - Command: `npm run test`
   - Run unit tests to ensure the reliability of the API. These tests cover a wide range of scenarios, including session management and error handling.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

Before running the API, set up the necessary environment variables in the `env.sample` file. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add these variables with your values, including the ones needed for express-session configuration.
